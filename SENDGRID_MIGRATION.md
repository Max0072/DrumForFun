# SendGrid Migration Guide

This document describes the migration from nodemailer to SendGrid for email sending in the Drum School application.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Dependencies
- **Removed**: `nodemailer` and `@types/nodemailer`
- **Added**: `@sendgrid/mail`

### 2. Core Email Service (`lib/email.ts`)
- Replaced nodemailer transporter with SendGrid client
- Updated email sending logic to use SendGrid API
- Maintained all existing email templates
- Added better error handling for SendGrid responses

### 3. API Routes Updated
The following API routes were migrated from direct nodemailer usage to using the centralized SendGrid service:

- **`app/api/checkout/route.ts`**: E-commerce order confirmation emails
- **`app/api/admin/orders/[id]/route.ts`**: Order status update emails

### 4. Environment Variables
**Old variables (no longer needed):**
```env
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@drumschool.com
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=true
SMTP_USER=username
SMTP_PASS=password
```

**New SendGrid variables:**
```env
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-sendgrid-api-key
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@drumschool.com
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@drumschool.com
```

## Setting Up SendGrid

### 1. Create SendGrid Account
1. Go to [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Verify your account and domain

### 2. Get API Key
1. In SendGrid dashboard, go to Settings > API Keys
2. Create a new API Key with "Full Access" or "Mail Send" permissions
3. Copy the API key (you won't be able to see it again!)

### 3. Verify Sender Identity
1. Go to Settings > Sender Authentication
2. Verify your domain OR single sender email address
3. This is required for SendGrid to send emails on your behalf

### 4. Update Environment Variables
Create/update your `.env` file:
```env
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your-actual-api-key-here
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@yourdomain.com
```

## Email Templates Maintained

All existing email templates remain the same:
- Booking system emails (admin notifications, confirmations, status updates)
- E-commerce emails (order confirmations, status updates, pickup instructions)
- Admin notifications

## Error Handling

The system includes graceful error handling:
- Email failures don't break core functionality (bookings/orders still succeed)
- Detailed error logging for debugging
- Demo mode when SendGrid is not configured (logs emails to console instead of sending)

## Testing

### Demo Mode
If `SENDGRID_API_KEY` is not set or equals `'your-sendgrid-api-key'`, the system runs in demo mode:
- Emails are logged to console instead of being sent
- All core functionality continues to work
- No actual emails are sent

### Production Testing
1. Set up SendGrid properly with real API key
2. Test booking creation (should send admin notification and customer confirmation)
3. Test booking status changes (should send status update emails)
4. Test order creation and status updates
5. Check SendGrid Activity dashboard for delivery status

## Benefits of SendGrid

1. **Reliability**: Better deliverability than SMTP
2. **Scalability**: Can handle high email volumes
3. **Analytics**: Built-in email analytics and tracking
4. **Templates**: Advanced template management (future enhancement)
5. **Reputation**: Dedicated IP options for better sender reputation

## Rollback Plan

If needed, you can rollback by:
1. `npm install nodemailer @types/nodemailer`
2. Restore the old `lib/email.ts` from git history
3. Restore old environment variables
4. Revert API route changes

## Future Enhancements

With SendGrid, you can now easily add:
- Email templates in SendGrid dashboard
- Email tracking and analytics
- Unsubscribe management
- Email scheduling
- A/B testing for emails
